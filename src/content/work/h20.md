>Description Of My Parapharmacy Application

Our online parapharmacy application offers a seamless and comprehensive user experience through several key graphical interfaces, developed using React for the front-end, incorporating CSS, Bootstrap for design, and JavaScript for interactivity. On the server side, we utilized Laravel for the back-end, integrating a custom API to manage essential data and functionalities.
